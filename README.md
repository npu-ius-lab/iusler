# NPU-IUSLer Robotics Team

## About

NPU-IUSLer is a team that represents the Intelligent Unmanned Systems Laboratory (IUSL) at the Unmanned System Research Institute (USRI), Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU), China, founded in 2020, aiming to participate in robotics competitions.
Our team focuses on the research of perception, self-localization, and robot navigation in changing environments. Under our research objectives, we had participated in a number of robot competitions including drone obstacle avoidance and F1TENTH autonomous racing (competitions under ICAUS 2021, 2022) in China. We are currently extending our research into the area of multi-robot perception and mission planning.

## Open Source

We have an air-ground robotics [course (in Chinese)](https://github.com/cavayangtao/npurobocourse) at NPU. In the course, you can find some [ROS code](https://github.com/cavayangtao/rmtt_ros/tree/main/rmtt_tracker/scripts) of object tracker, gesture controller, path tracker, etc. We will continue to enrich the open-source content by participating in robotics competitions.
